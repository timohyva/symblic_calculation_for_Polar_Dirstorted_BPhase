# symblic_calculation_for_Polar_Dirstorted_BPhase

These files involve my research project about Domain wall and topological defects in Polar Distorted B Phase.
The results are contained in my publications:
Phys. Rev. Research 2, 043356, link : https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.043356
 Nat Commun 10, 237 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08204-8

These files are Mathematica scripts, whcih were used to analytically derive, calculate therms in Free energies and hydrodynamic equations.
